# Market Risk Assessment Project
This repository contains a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and quantifying market risk, focusing on a portfolio of large-cap equities and major currencies.

### Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of market risk using advanced quantitative techniques. It evaluates a portfolio of large-cap equities and major currencies through Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall, and stress testing, offering actionable insights for risk management and portfolio optimization.

### Key Objectives
- Implement risk assessment techniques, including VaR, Expected Shortfall, and stress testing.
- Use historical simulation, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian models to evaluate portfolio risk.
- Quantify and analyze portfolio risks to guide strategic decision-making.
